## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 

This project utilizes the Math object to produce random numbers which are assigned a weapon. The programming used to build this site is very basic yet allows you to understand the limitless possibilities when interacting with users. 


Starting with more focused and smaller projects allowed me to embrace versatile functions and all its capabilities. In doing so, I was also able to strength my CSS skills while diving deep into focus mode on very basic fundamental functions.

## Lessons Learned:


Our programming creativity is limited to the exisiting integers and floats. Infinite.  

Impletementing Math objects and basic functions. 

*Grinning, cheek to cheek!*

Learned that with practice can come perfect. One step closer to perfecting the foundations of user interaction. 

Impletementing mathematical operators and functions.
